  	<h1>Hey peeps!</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my Gallery.</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Anton', sans-serif">
<big>I</big> am Shubham Das hailing from Rayagada, Odisha. I'm currently pursuing my degree in BTech Computer Science from Gitam University, Visakhapatnam. Photography has always been my core interest's. It not only captures the moment but also gives a beautiful chance to relive them once again. My favourite genre of photography is Nature,which is one of the greatest creation on earth. The pleasure of embracing and capturing the dynamicity of mother Nature is unparalleled . Nature has always given me a hope for better tomorrow and taught me beginnings can be beautiful.  So here I'm, following my passion and taking my finest hobby of  photography to a whole new level. Also, I'm planning to take up travelling  in future where I leave no stone unturned. I'm eternally grateful for the peace and warmth that nature has given me. Can't wait to explore it's beauty wherever I go.
