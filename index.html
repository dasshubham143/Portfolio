   	<big>M</big>oments sad or bad,happy or shaggy we live them to the fullest. But once the moments is gone its gone forever. Technology being a born,introduced us to photography.It captures all the sceneria , stories , emotions in a single snap.A frame can take us back to hell lot of incidents,memories,stories and moments that we cherished.We freeze a moment,a precious one when we capture an image.We capture the subtle reality which feels more than the real things.We relive our lines through a simple scroll in our gallery.we relive these moments,good or bad,joufull or silly,we relive our achievements,our failures and it is all possible due to photography.Photography is a feeling we feel what we look at, we feel the emotions behind the pictur and a true photographer never fails to capture the feelings behind every picture.We cry as we see our happy momentswe smile while cherishing our old bad moments thinking how silly we used to be.Every time we photograph something,we keep a moment with us.
